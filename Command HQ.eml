Well, glad to see you've picked the project back up again!!!
I sure wish I could. ;-)  Good luck!

It's been SO long since I looked at the code, it took some refreshing to
figure out what was where. Sorry it took so long to get back to ya.

As for your questions ...

There are 184 possible locations for cities/oil wells in the ???? =
scenario,
which basically include all of the locations used in the earlier =
scenarios,
plus a bunch more used only in ????.  In that scenario, we basically
randomly select 84 (NUM_CBR, Number of Cities, Bases, or Resources) of =
those
possible 184 (NUM_REGION) locations, and use them. We then go through =
and
pick the most inaccessible cities (the ones furthest away from other
resources) and choose those to be the bases. That's why certain remote =
spots
tend to always be bases, and places around city clusters tend not to be. =
 We
also then randomly pick a city to be one side's capital, and look for a =
city
that is about as equally remote to be the other person's capital, so we
don't have one cap near all the resources and the other be very remote, =
in
order to make it a more fair and even game.

Here is the code snipped that calculates the cities for a Random World, =
if
you can make heads or tails of it.  ;-)

(Note:  This code was written by MicroProse, not me... so I am not to be
blamed for it being very hard to read.  My code tends to be much better
commented and documented. ;-) )

Hello, it's me again.  Hope all is going well for you and this email=20
address is still active.

I'm finally getting a chance to work on this again, and making some=20
progress.  I'm now working on placing armies, cities, etc as you suggest =

below.  Could you share with me the locations of the=20
cities/bases/oilfields in the various scenarios (including the=20
methodology for choosing city/base locations in the ???? scenario)?  I=20
assume it is something like a coordinate for each city, base, and oil=20
field, and optionally a name. In ???? it seems that the locations are=20
chosen randomly from a set of available locations, and some locations=20
appear to exhibit a preference for a specific location type (some are=20
always bases, for instance).

Thanks,
Kevin
